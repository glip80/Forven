"""Pure reconciliation between the execution kernel's view and recorded paper trades.

The live/paper scanner, each closed bar, runs the shared ``execution_kernel`` over a
strategy's history (via ``backtest.run_strategy_execution``) and gets a
:class:`~forven.strategies.execution_kernel.KernelResult` — the trades the backtest
WOULD have taken and the position it WOULD currently hold. This module turns that view
plus the strategy's already-recorded paper trades into a list of concrete actions
(open / close / backfill / refresh) for the scanner to apply.

Keeping this logic pure (no DB, no exchange) is what lets us prove, bar-by-bar, that
the resulting paper trades equal the backtest's trades — parity by construction — in a
fast unit test. The scanner layer only has to apply the actions via its existing
persistence/execution calls.

Matching is by ``(direction, entry_time)``: the kernel's ``entry_time`` is the bar's
open timestamp string (``str(df.index[idx])``), identical across runs over a growing
history prefix, so a recorded paper trade and its kernel counterpart line up exactly.
This is robust to missed scan cycles: any kernel-closed trade with no recorded
counterpart is backfilled, so a gap in scanner uptime never loses trades.

    ``recorded`` is the strategy's paper trades (open and closed), each a dict with at
    least ``direction``, ``entry_time`` and ``status`` ("open"/"closed"). The kernel
    ``res`` never force-closes, so ``res.closed_trades`` are real exits and
    ``res.open_positions`` is what should be live now.

    ``recent_cutoff`` (an ISO timestamp string, same format the kernel uses for
    ``entry_time``) bounds what gets RECORDED to "from go-live forward": kernel trades
    that ENTERED before it are treated as pre-tracking — their backfill is suppressed
    and such open positions are NOT adopted (they belong on the chart as triggers, not
    as actual trades). This is what stops a fresh/reset paper book from replaying the
    strategy's ENTIRE would-be history as trades. Closes/refreshes of ALREADY-recorded
    trades always proceed regardless of the cutoff. ``None`` (default) = full replay,
    which is the backtest-parity semantics the tests assert.

    ``late_entry`` (paper only) changes how a STALE-but-still-held kernel position is
    handled: when the kernel currently holds a position whose entry predates the cutoff
    and there's no recorded counterpart, instead of leaving it untouched (a chart trigger
    only), emit a ``late_entry`` open so the scanner HOPS IN at the current price/time.
    This is the "the signal is still active, so take the position now" behaviour. Keyed
    by the kernel's historical entry_time so subsequent scans REFRESH (not re-open) it.
    ``False`` (default) keeps the original suppress-stale behaviour (and parity).

    Actions, in apply order:
      * ``close``    — a recorded OPEN trade the kernel has now finalized.
      * ``backfill`` — a kernel-finalized trade (entry ≥ cutoff) with no recorded
                       counterpart (opened & closed between scans) → record it closed.
      * ``open``     — a kernel OPEN position (entry ≥ cutoff) with no recorded
                       counterpart → open it.
      * ``refresh``  — a kernel OPEN position matching a recorded OPEN trade → update
                       its SL/TP/trailing for display.
